# Key Prompts Used to Build SnapNote

## 1. Initial Project Request
```
I want to build a tool that allows users to upload either a screenshot (JPG/PNG) 
or a PDF file. The tool should automatically extract all text from the uploaded file, 
summarize it using Azure OpenAI, and allow the user to download a clean Notes PDF 
containing the extracted text and the AI-generated summary.
```

## 2. Bug Fix Request
```
When I click summarize with AI then Error summarizing text: 
Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'
```

## 3. UI Enhancement Request
```
Now working need Good UI and animation because brief summary looking like plain text
```

## 4. Animated Background Request
```

```

## 5. Cleanup Request
```

```

## 6. Submission Preparation
```
